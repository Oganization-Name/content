# SCRF Mandate - Content Team
The content team is obsessed with impactful research in the web3 ecosystem. It is our job to be SCRF’s watch out for these interesting works and bring them to the forum.

## The Team’s Mission
Research is difficult and sometimes even lonely. Across academia, important work is created but there is no way to ensure visibility, let alone recognition of its impact. This is troubling because tremendous amounts of effort are poured into the actual research, yet it takes this last step to bring change and inspiration.

SCRF is on a quest to solve this last mile problem. We find interesting research and try to bring out the best of it, pushing the impact of the work to a fuller form.

We envision SCRF as a premier research hub that connects academia, industry and anything in between. SCRF is responsible for getting the right people to talk about important content, and building a space to kindle conversations that exchange effective solutions to answer research questions or problems in practice.

We look forward to seeing web3 advance from a proof-of-concept to a fully functioning ecosystem. We believe we are just at the beginning of a new era that isn’t fully defined, making it the best and worst of times. The content team is responsible for starting all the fun by discovering interesting research and seeing them realize their full form.

## The plan
1. Search
The first step to raising awareness of impactful research is by finding interesting work and marking them out.

2. Highlight
Not only do we search for important work, but also we make the work accessible by explaining it in a more approachable way for a wider audience. 

3. Contextualize
We reason where the work belongs in a larger context, that is, we try to uncover how it could be impactful for the community as a whole.

## Pillars
These pillars serve as guidelines. We use them for selecting work that we choose to run with the plan, on what to highlight, and how to contextualize.
The following qualities do not have to coexist in a single piece of work:

1. In-Depth (synonyms: sophisticated, serious. antonyms: superficial, sketchy)
The work is not superficial and carries a certain level of complexity. It is a piece of serious work that makes sense to experts in that domain.
Seeking work with depth does not mean that we are abandoning novices to this space, but signaling respect towards

2. Practical (synonyms: applicable, realistic. antonyms: philosophized)
This is work that can be applied to real-world problems. It is not living in an ivory tower, but something that can be applied to solve real-world problems.
Practical work does not have to be technical, but it has to be built upon a pressing problem in the industry.

3. Novel (synonyms: innovating, creative, enlightening. antonyms: repetitive)
The work tackles the research question with a new approach, and the technique or paradigm is innovative.

4. Timely (synonyms: recent, current, trending. antonyms: stale, outdated)
The work is on top of the rapid evolution of this space. It addresses a topic that has come to attention.
